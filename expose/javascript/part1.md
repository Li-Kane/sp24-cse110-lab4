1. "values added: 20"
2. "final result: 20"
3. "values added: 20". Later, there is an error as explained in question 4.
4. There is an error because let is block scoped, meaning it is only available within the if statement. Therefore, the console.log that uses result outside of the if statement has no value for result and errors.
5. Error: you cannot reassign to result, since it is declared as a const. So result = num1 + num2 is an error.
6. This line is not run due to the error from question 5. Due to the previous fatal error, no more code is run.
